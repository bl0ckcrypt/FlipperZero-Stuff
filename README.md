## About The Project

*tba* (the Bitrefill API) is my own collection of their API endpoints to help developers & resellers to integrate Bitrefill to their sites. I have collected over *NaN* API endpoints and written over *Na*N lines of documentation.

## Getting Started

You can start to use *tba* either by getting a local copy of this repository and using the RAW API endpoints or by using _ready-made_ examples (currently **Python** only, more coming soon.)

### Prerequisites

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

- 1. Clone this repository
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/somerepo.git
  ```
  
- 2. Navigate to the repository folders and choose if you want to use _ready-made example_ or _RAW API endpoints_
  ```sh
  cd Bitrefill-API
  ```
    
## Usage

Full documentation is available to help you understand how everything works (_[Documentation](https://example.com)_).
